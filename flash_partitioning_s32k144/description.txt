Writes, verifies and erases data on Flash
The FlexNVM memory is partitioned to EEPROM use and is blocked for some erase commands (Erase Sector and Erase Block). As a consequence, loading the program to flash memory may fail on some debuggers. Please perform a mass erase operation on Flash to remove this partitioning after running the example to be able to update your application on target.
The example documentation can be found in the S32 SDK documentation at Examples and Demos section. (<SDK_PATH>/doc/Start_Here.html)
